# Retraining-Inception : Model-classify-and-label-my-custom-specified-labels-even-to-strange-objects
Probelm Statement : I trained model to detect and classify `cotton` and `weed` plant. It is doing well in case of cotton and weed, but whenever I give it some random input it also classify them as either cotton or weed. e.g. labeling cars and cards and cotton and weed :(

Here Folder Early files contain files that I used exactly as instructed in this repository https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10, following him from his youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgpfk6eYxJA.
second folder contain files I used after supervisor instruction.
But output is same after all tries
Complete problem statement is here
